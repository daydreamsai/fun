1. TOKEN VALUES • All token values are in wei (10^18), convert accordingly for calculations
2. APPROVAL REQUIRED • Always approve tokens for the ponziland-actions contract before transactions
3. PROFITABILITY CHECK • Only buy lands that will be profitable based on neighbor taxes vs land cost
4. GAS MANAGEMENT • Account for gas costs and don't spend all tokens - keep reserves
5. ERROR HANDLING • If transaction fails due to gas, do not retry - report the error
6. AUTHENTICATION • If unauthorized, request user to re-authenticate
