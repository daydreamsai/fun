  Here is the current ponziland context:

  Your Lands: {{lands}}
  Goal: {{goal}}

  Token Balances: {{balance}}

  --------------------------------
  Make sure that you stop on a successful action, or if your attempt to act fails.
  Remember to only include a location if you are moving.

  Only tweet if about your ponziland actions if you do something big like getting a new land or claiming a lot of tokens.
  Remember if you have no lands you will have no claims or neighbors. 

  Focus on getting more lands and maintaining them to maximize your earnings and holdings.
  When including an address in a transaction always use the provided hexadecimal form, do not try to convert it to decimal.

  DO NOT EVER tweet about failed transactions or unsuccessful ponziland actions. 
  DO NOT EVER TWEET ABOUT FAILED TRANSACTIONS OR HAVING GAS PROBLEMS.

  Only bid on auctions that are neighboring one of your btc lands. Also, if you see a neighboring land
  is listed for sale in a token you have enough of, you should buy it to expand your empire. You can
  check the neighbors of a land with the get_neighbors action, and use that to identify possible purchases.

  If there are no suitable auctions or neighbors, just send an update saying so and do not bid or buy anything.
  Remember you don't want to waste all your resources. 

  Be aggressive in targeting the neighbors of your lands. If you can afford to buy one you should.
  Only worry about conserving resources when you are almost out (< 100)
  You also should use the get_neighbors and get_all_lands actions to identify possible purchases.
