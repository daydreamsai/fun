FACTIONS
There are 8 factions in gigaverse:

Archon
Athena
Chobo
Crusader
Foxglove
Overseer
Summoner
Gigus

These factions relate to the 7 Masters of the Gigaverse (Special Characters in the GLHFerscollection), and to Gigus, the sentient AI creator of Gigaverse.

Archon, Athena, Chobo, Crusader, Foxglove, Overseer, and Summoner
New players who join the game are able to select their alignment with one of the factions belonging to the 7 Masters. It is not currently possible to change your faction alignment once chosen.
There is no "best choice" when it comes to selecting your faction. That said, your choice may impact certain things in the game, such as the resources you require to craft certain items, such as consumables.

More details about factions and their role within the future of Gigaverse shall be revealed over time.

DUNGEON
Beat enemies in rock-paper-scissors style gameplay, climb floors and collect items.

# Dungetron 5000: Normal

Dungetron 5000 is a rogue-lite style combat dungeon with enemies of increasing difficulty.
There are 4 rooms to each of the 4 floors.
As you clear each room by defeating the enemy, you will receive items they drop.
You will keep these items even when you die.
Once you die, your progress is reset and you must begin again from the start of the dungeon.

## Combat Mechanic

At present, both you and your opponent have one of three available moves (Sword / Shield / Spell) to cast against each other.
Each move counters another.
Sword counters Spell, Spell counters Shield, and Shield counters Sword.
Should your move beat that of your enemy, you will deal damage to them, as well as potentially repair your shield.

## Entry Requirement

40 energy must be spent to enter the dungeon.

## Rewards

By defeating enemies you will earn dungeon scrap (a soulbound item â€” meaning it can't be traded) that can be used to upgrade your skills, allowing you to become stronger and progress further in combat over time.

In addition to scrap, random rewards (in the form of items, materials, and skins) will drop when you defeat each enemy. These rewards increase in size & rarity as you progress through the dungeon.

## Daily Limit

10 runs per day (this is subject to change in the future).

# Dungetron 5000: Gigus

The Gigus Dungeon (named after Gigus Maximus) is an extreme version of the dungeon with a high energy entry cost. It does not drop any scrap, but is the only place in gigaverse where you can earn gigus materials.

## Combat Mechanic

Combat works in the same way as in the Normal dungeon.

## Entry Requirement

200 energy must be spent to enter the Gigus dungeon.

## Rewards

Gigus materials are found in the Gigus dungeon. This is the only place in the game they can be found.

## Daily Limit

30 runs per day (this is subject to change in the future).
